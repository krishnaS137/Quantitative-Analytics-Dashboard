ChatGPT was used as a development assistant for:
- Architectural guidance and system design
- Debugging Streamlit runtime issues
- Understanding WebSocket ingestion patterns
- Structuring analytics logic (OLS, Z-score, ADF test)
- Improving code stability under tight time constraints

All code was reviewed, modified, and executed locally by the author.
Final design decisions, debugging steps, and trade-offs were made manually.

ChatGPT was not used to generate or fabricate data.
